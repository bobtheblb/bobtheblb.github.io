I'm a Thesis M.S student at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) currently working in the [Dynamic Robotics and AI Lab](https://mime.engineering.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/), advised by [Dr. Alan Fern](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/alan-fern). I currently work on developing robust learning-based controllers for legged terrestrial robots.

Before all that, I completed my Honor's B.S in Computer Science here at OSU. I completed my [Honor's Thesis](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/rdml/sites/research.engr.oregonstate.edu.rdml/files/kevinchang2025revised.pdf) on autonomous docking of thruster-driven underwater vehicles, under the supervision of [Dr. Geoffrey Hollinger](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/geoff-hollinger). I've also interned at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/) through their Summer Student Fellowship program where I conducted research on [learning-based controls for mobile underwater robots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00120) under the mentorship of [Dr. Yogesh Girdhar](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/ygirdhar/). Before all that I interned for a few summers at [MiCROTEC](https://www.microtec.com/en-us) where I helped revolutionize the lumber industry by training and deploying computer vision models to inspect lumber quality.
