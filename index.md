title: "Hi! My name is Kevin."

I'm a Thesis M.S student at Oregon State University currently working in the Dynamic Robotics and AI Lab, advised by Dr. Alan Fern. I currently work on developing robust learning-based controllers for legged terrestrial robots.

Before all that, I completed my Honor's B.S in Computer Science here at OSU. I completed my Honor's Thesis on autonomous docking of thruster-driven underwater vehicles, under the supervision of Dr. Geoffrey Hollinger. I've also interned at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution through their Summer Student Fellowship program where I conducted research on learning-based controls for mobile nuderwater robots under the mentorship of Dr. Yogesh Girdhar. Before all that I intered for a few summers at MiCROTEC where I helped revolutionize the lumber industry by training and deploying computer vision models to inspect lumber quality.
